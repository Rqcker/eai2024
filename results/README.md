### Results Directory

This directory will house the results of our experiments and analyses. These results will be shared publicly in due course, contingent upon internal review and adherence to the [EPSRC Data Storage Policy](https://www.ukri.org/who-we-are/epsrc/our-policies-and-standards/policy-framework-on-research-data/principles/) and [GDPR Regulations](https://gdpr-info.eu/).

Our team will ensure that all results are vetted for compliance with these standards before publication to maintain the integrity and confidentiality of the research data.
